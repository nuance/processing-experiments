Processing-Experiments
======================

Experiments with combining [processingjs](http://processingjs.org), [webpy](http://webpy.org) and the [prototype js framework](http://prototypejs.org)

My motivation behind all of these is to create some fun visualizations that can interact with real web applications - webpy gives me a very lightweight and fast way to mock out a backend while concentrating on the meat of the visualization portion.
